   # üìö Poch'Lib 
  This application is meant to be used as a personalized booklist, using Google Books API. 

  ‚û°Ô∏è **Context :**
  ‚ÄúLa Plume enchant√©e‚Äù asked me to create an application that will enable their clients to search for books online and then pick them up at the bookshop.

  ‚û°Ô∏è **Specifications :** 
  This project meets the requirements of the client, in terms of coding and design.

  
  ## üé• Sneak peak : 

**What can you _(the user)_ do with the Poch'Lib app ?**
* Search a book thanks to the Google Books API
* Add the books you want to your list by clicking on the bookmark icon
* Do as many research and addition to your list as you want (the more book the better, right ?)
* Remove the books from your list as you buy them (or read a bad review) by clicking on the trash icon

**What does it look like ?**
